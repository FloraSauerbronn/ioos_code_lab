    "# Using AphiaIDs to download OBIS occurrences for Bio/Eco EOVs\n",

    "The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a global network of ocean observing systems led by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. NOAA's U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) is a part of this global network. GOOS has developed Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) to help harmonize data that is collected across various ocean observing systems around the globe. The [GOOS Biology and Ecosystems Variables](https://goosocean.org/what-we-do/framework/essential-ocean-variables/) are focused on the abundance and distribution of specific groups of aquatic organisms that are important for ecosystems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [IOOS Marine Life Data Network](https://ioos.github.io/marine_life_data_network/) has developed [lists of biological taxa](https://https://github.com/ioos/marine_life_data_network/tree/main/eov_taxonomy) and their identifiers (in this case, aphiaIDs) that can be used to query published biological occurrence data in the [Ocean Biodiversity Information System](https://www.obis.org/) (OBIS).\n",
    "\n",
    "OBIS uses the [World Register of Marine Species](https://marinespecies.org) (WoRMS) to provide a taxonomic backbone for all of the records in the database, and WoRMS only contains marine species. Therefore, the lists developed by the IOOS Marine Life Data Network leverage the taxonomic scope of WoRMS to perform high-level queries without requiring a detailed list of every species of seabird, for example. Once a query is complete, users can begin analyzing OBIS occurrence data to assess the abundance, distribution, and other characteristics of the taxa in these BioEco Variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an example in R for how to use the Marine Life Data Network's list of AphiaIDs for the GOOS BioEco Variables to perform an OBIS query. This particular notebook uses mangroves as an example, but the query could be edited for any of the BioEco EOVs."
